    <h1>Interneting is easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
    
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordred list)</li>
        <li>Add each item to its own "li" element</li>
        <li>The don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em> you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>Other times, you need to <b>strong</b>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><b><em>And sometimes, you need to shout!</em></b></p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>The authors.</p>
